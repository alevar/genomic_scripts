Ender is a method designed to perform 3' and 5' correction of a query annotation based on the reference annotation. Ender takes into account CDS features within both reference and query files. Ender does not assume sorted order of the annotation, but can only handle transcript, exon and CDS feature types specified in either GTF or GFF3 formats.
